In a recent year, more than 46,500 students attended the multicampus institution, and around 36 percent of them pursued bachelor’s degrees. Roughly one-fifth of the total student body was international during that same year. The cost to attend the university is the same for native and international degree-seeking students, and student housing is available through the public organization CROUS.\n\nStudies at the university are offered across five broad academic disciplines: arts, literature and languages; law, economics, management, political and social sciences; social sciences and humanities; science and technology; and health. The primary language of instruction is French, but several graduate-level degrees are taught partially in English. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. The Université de Strasbourg belongs to a network of five universities located in the Upper Rhine Valley called EUCOR. These universities – Strasbourg and the Université de Haute-Alsace in France, the University of Freiburg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and the University of Basel in Switzerland – cooperate on joint academic and research programs. Students at these universities can take courses at other EUCOR institutions without having to pay additional fees. Among the Université de Strasbourg’s research units are the Centre for the Analysis of Antique Religious Rhetoric, the Institute of Supramolecular Science and Engineering and the Institute of Cellular and Integrative Neurosciences."},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-aberdeen-501749","id":501749,"name":"University of Aberdeen","city":"Aberdeen","country_name":"United Kingdom","three_digit_country_code":"GBR","ranks":[{"value":"277","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.3","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"13,010","label":"Enrollment"}],"blurb":""},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-kiel-504681","id":504681,"name":"University of Kiel","city":"Kiel","country_name":"Germany","three_digit_country_code":"DEU","ranks":[{"value":"280","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.2","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"N/A","label":"Enrollment"}],"blurb":""},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-york-uk-505776","id":505776,"name":"University of York - UK","city":"York","country_name":"United Kingdom","three_digit_country_code":"GBR","ranks":[{"value":"280","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.2","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"17,965","label":"Enrollment"}],"blurb":""},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/china-university-of-geosciences-506930","id":506930,"name":"China University of Geosciences","city":"Wuhan","country_name":"China","three_digit_country_code":"CHN","ranks":[{"value":"282","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.1","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"N/A","label":"Enrollment"}],"blurb":""},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/international-school-for-advanced-studies-sissa-528824","id":528824,"name":"International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)","city":"Trieste","country_name":"Italy","three_digit_country_code":"ITA","ranks":[{"value":"282","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.1","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"N/A","label":"Enrollment"}],"blurb":""},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/korea-advanced-institute-of-science-technology-kaist-506336","id":506336,"name":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","city":"Daejeon","country_name":"South Korea","three_digit_country_code":"KOR","ranks":[{"value":"282","is_tied":true,"is_ranked":true,"label":"Best Global Universities"}],"stats":[{"value":"59.1","label":"Global Score"},{"value":"9,946","label":"Enrollment"}],"image_url":{"src":"https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000155-e571-d548-a175-ed7931a20000/$160713_KAIST?size=responsive300&update-time=1468433363032","medium":"https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000155-e571-d548-a175-ed7931a20000/$160713_KAIST?size=responsive300&update-time=1468433363032","large":"https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000155-e571-d548-a175-ed7931a20000/$160713_KAIST?size=responsive640&update-time=1468433363032"},"blurb":"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, commonly known as KAIST, is a public institution that was founded in 1971.

The institution traces its roots back to 1881, when it was originally founded as the Tokyo Vocational School. The science- and technology-focused university is spread across three campuses – Ookayama, Suzukakedai and Tamachi. The Ookayama campus, Tokyo Tech's main location, is situated in the Meguro City area of Tokyo. In a recent year, more than 9,500 students attended Tokyo Tech. Around half of the school's students are undergraduates, while the other half are enrolled in master's and doctoral programs. Roughly 12 percent of the total student body is international. Tuition is the same for Japanese and international students, and some university housing is available.\n\nTokyo Tech has six schools: science, engineering, materials and chemical technology, computing, life science and technology, and environment and society. There is also the Institute for Liberal Arts, which offers courses in foreign languages, the humanities and other subjects to supplement students' science training. The university’s academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is Japanese. Students at all degree levels can get involved with research at Tokyo Tech. During their fourth year, undergraduates conduct research for their bachelor’s degree thesis by joining their academic adviser’s laboratory. More than 90 percent of the university's undergraduates go on to pursue graduate-level degrees. Tokyo Tech master’s and doctoral students also become affiliated with laboratories at the university. Some of the university's labs are the Chemical Resources Laboratory, the Precision and Intelligence Laboratory and the Research Laboratory for Nuclear

Tuition costs at the university are the same for domestic and international students, though they vary by subject, with science and engineering degree programs costing more. The university, government agencies and private organizations provide some scholarships for international students. University housing is available, with priority given to foreign students; many faculty members also live on campus.\n\nThe university has several colleges – science, engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, humanities and social sciences, life science, nuclear science and technology management –  and its academic calendar is semester-based. The primary language of instruction is Mandarin, though some of the university's courses are offered in English. A few fully English-taught degree options, including an international MBA in technology management, are also available. Some of National Tsing Hua University's research centers are the Nuclear Science and Technology Development Center; the Center for Science, Technology and Society; and the Center for Energy and Environmental Research. The university has agreements for research, exchange and other joint activities with more than 100 universities around the world, such as Zhejiang University in China, Kyoto University in Japan and

University of Science and Technology, also known as POSTECH, is a private institution that was founded in 1986. The science- and engineering-focused university is located in the city of Pohang, South Korea, approximately 250 miles southeast of the capital city, Seoul. In a recent year, upward of 3,000 students attended the university and approximately 40 percent of them studied at the undergraduate level. Tuition is the same for international and domestic students, and many POSTECH students receive university or government scholarships and grants. Additionally, new international graduate students at POSTECH receive a settlement allowance during their first semester to help cover relocation expenses. University student housing is available for both undergraduate- and graduate-level students.\n\nThe university has academic divisions that focus mainly on science, engineering and technology. Both Korean and English are spoken in POSTECH classrooms. In a recent year, around 85 percent of courses that counted toward undergraduate and graduate majors were offered in English. However, if students want to brush up on their Korean language skills, they can take classes through the POSTECH Korean Language Program. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar, with the school year beginning in March.

Indian Institute of Science is a public institution that was founded in 1909. The university is located in the city of Bangalore in southern India. In a recent year, upward of 3,000 students attended the university, and the vast majority of them – 89 percent – studied at the graduate level. The school's relatively new undergraduate program is research-focused. The first class of bachelor’s students graduated from the school in 2015. International students cannot enroll in the undergraduate program, but they can apply to the university's graduate-level programs. However, in a recent year, less than 1 percent of the student body was international. The Indian Institute of Science is a residential school – nearly all of its undergraduate- and graduate-level students live in on-campus student housing.\n\nThe science- and engineering-focused institution has six academic divisions, each with multiple departments: biological sciences, chemical sciences, electrical sciences, interdisciplinary research, mechanical sciences, and physical and mathematical sciences. The university uses a semester-based academic calendar, and the language of instruction at all levels of study is English. Tuition is the same for domestic and international students. All students at the university receive stipends that cover some or all of their tuition and living costs. Federal government grants fund many of these stipends. Among the university’s research centers are the Center for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning, the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and the Centre for Brain Research."},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/ollscoil-na-gaillimhe-university-of-galway-505038","id":505038,"name":"Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of

1931 as Tainan Technical College. The university is located in the city of Tainan, in southwest Taiwan, and received its current name in 1971. It has 11 campuses, eight of which are adjacent to each other and collectively form the main campus area. In a recent year, upward of 21,000 students attended National Cheng Kung University, and a little more than half of them studied at the undergraduate level. Tuition costs vary by subject and are higher for international students, who can apply for university- and government-sponsored scholarships. Housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe university has colleges focused on a variety of subjects: liberal arts, sciences, engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, planning and design, management, social science, medicine, and bioscience and biotechnology. Its academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is Chinese. However, some classes and a handful of degree programs – mostly at the graduate level – are taught in English. Degree-seeking international students can also take free Chinese language courses. National Cheng Kung University's research centers include the University Center for Bioscience and Biotechnology, the Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy, and the Medical Device Innovation Center. University researchers were involved in the construction of the Formosat-2 satellite, which launched in 2004 and carried the National Cheng Kung University flag into outer space."},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rochester-institute-of-technology-195003","id":195003,"name":"Rochester Institute of
